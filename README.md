## Description

This Updated-Portfolio-Page-2, I have made an updated a lot of things. If you want to view my previous work you can click on **Updated Portfolio Page 1**, I display all my works, Password Generator, Code Quiz, Day Planner, Weather Dashboard, BCKS project and my graphic designs. In this Portfolio you can view Project 2 Password Manager, Professional README Generator, Team Profile Generator, Note Taker, Employee Tracker, E Commerce Backend and Tech Blog. I am using a combination of HTML, Css, Bootstrap 4, and Java Script to create my Update Portfolio Page 2. I have `index.html` as a homepage, `design1.html` as a Design Collection Template for House for Sale, `design2.html` and `design3.html` as a Design Collection Template for advertisement and `video.html` is a short video **Thank You for Watching**.  For the responsiveness in CSS I use `@media Query` and I used Bootstrap to make the image and video fully responsive. I created some image is black and white color, but when you touch it, will be back to normal color, I use class Greyscale, on css I created `.grayscale:hover {-webkit-filter: grayscale(0%); filter: grayscale(0%);}`. For all the icon I use vscode extention **React Icons**. I have difficulties to push my video to Github because the data is to big and I reduce it only 5,1 MB, but unfortunately still unsuccessful because the video I have deleted still in there. Eventually I install GitKraken to manage so I can delete my big data video and success.
